# CI/CD Overview - Notion Assistant

This document provides an educational overview of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) process used in the Notion Assistant project.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is a software development methodology that aims to automate the process of code integration, testing, and deployment.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of frequently merging code changes and automatically verifying code quality through automated tests.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: An extension of CI that automates the delivery of verified code to production or pre-production environments.

## CI/CD Flow in the Project

Notion Assistant uses a modern CI/CD flow to ensure changes are tested and deployed reliably and consistently.

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│         │     │         │     │         │     │         │     │         │
│   Code  │────►│   Push  │────►│  Build  │────►│  Test   │────►│ Deploy  │
│         │     │         │     │         │     │         │     │         │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
```

### 1. Code Development

Developers work on features or fixes in dedicated branches, following the practices described in [How to Contribute](../03-contribution/00-how-to-contribute.md).

### 2. Integration (Push)

When a developer pushes code to the repository (or creates a Pull Request), the CI/CD process is automatically triggered.

### 3. Build

The CI/CD system:
- Clones the repository
- Installs dependencies
- Compiles the code (if needed)
- Builds Docker images for application components

### 4. Testing

After building, the system automatically runs:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Code quality analysis
- Security checks

### 5. Deploy

If all tests pass, the system:
- Publishes Docker images to a repository
- Connects to the production server
- Updates containers with new versions
- Verifies application health after deployment

## Tools Used

The project uses modern tools for the CI/CD pipeline:

- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik

## CI/CD Security

To maintain security in the CI/CD pipeline, the project uses:
- Secure secrets for storing sensitive information
- SSH access with cryptographic keys
- Minimal necessary permissions for the pipeline
- Verified and updated Docker images

## Monitoring and Recovery

After deployment, the system monitors:
- Application availability
- Resource usage
- Error logs

In case of failure, rollback strategies can be triggered to quickly revert to a previous stable version.

## Staging Environment

Before deploying to production, changes are tested in a staging environment that simulates the production environment, ensuring everything works as expected.

## Conclusion

CI/CD is an essential part of modern development, enabling fast and reliable iterations. In Notion Assistant, the process is designed to be efficient and secure, ensuring a continuous experience for users.
